    <h1>Players From Islamabad</h1>
    <h2>Ahmed Shehzad</h2>
    <img src="../../images/ahmed.webp"  width="300px height=300px" />
    <p>Talent doesn't guarantee success but hard work coupled with smart work garnished with a pinch of luck does it for you, well mostly. Ahmed Shehzad is one of those talented batsman that Pakistan have tried to nurture over a decade now. He made his debut as a 17-year old against the mighty Aussies in an ODI series and despite the struggle was retained for the away series against New Zealand. The harbinger to the world was his blistering ton at the Seddon Park. But a disastrous World Cup of 2011 and Ahmed Shehzad was sent into exile for good 2 years. For someone whose first 3 ODI tons were centuries in New Zealand, West Indies and South Africa, inconsistency came in regular bouts.

        Having made his first-class debut at the age of 16 in 2007 for Lahore, Ahmed rose the ladder to international cricket quicker than his peers to picked for the ODI team. In between that he was part of the under-19 World Cup team in 2008. In 2009, Ahmed Shahzad and his team mates became World Champions in the T20 format under the leadership of Younis Khan. Though he played only one game, Ahmed's hunger to succeed received a major shot in the arm. In the 2014 T20 World Cup, he became the first cricketer from Pakistan to score hundreds in every format of the game.
        
        The Taste of Tests came almost 4 years after his ODI debut but immediately impressed with a fine ton in only his third Test against Sri Lanka in his debut series. Hundreds at the adopted home in the UAE against Australia and New Zealand only gave him new wings for a higher flight in his career. But a poor series against Sri Lanka in the Lankan conditions forced the selectors to have him out of contention in the Test team. Concurrently, he lost his place in the ODI team as well post the 2015 World Cup.
        
        Issues of fitness and discipline were making headlines for Ahmed and runs had taken a backseat. But strong performances at the domestic level and in the 2016 and 2017 PSL, kept reminding the selectors about the pedigree that he still possessed. He got his position back in the team for the tour to Windies in 2017 and is also geared up to play the Champions Trophy in England. Often referred to as Pakistan's Virat Kohli, Ahmed would want his bat to do all the talking in the second half of the marathon that has just flagged off.
        
        Pakistan's tale with talented batsmen groomed into a consistent batsmen at the top level has too many cases of failures. The sustainability for the raw talents for a longer period of time at the big level has been a plaguing issue. A heir to Saeed Anwar's throne might as well have an answer in the form of the 'Shehzada' of Pakistan cricket.</p>
       
    <h2>Shahid Afridi</h2>
    <p>Shahid Afridi, Pakistan's allrounder, is as enigmatic a player as there ever was. He came as a 16-year-old into the Pakistan ODI squad and was unfazed by all the speculation regarding his real age. In only his second ODI against Sri Lanka in 1996, he blasted his way to a 37-ball century. For more than 17 years, it remained the fastest century in the ODI format before Corey Anderson broke the record in January 2014. Afridi's sparkling ton came after he was sent in as a pinch-hitter at one drop and after being picked in the team as a leg-spinner to replace the injured Mushtaq Ahmed!

        For the next few years, Afridi's batting took prominence after hitting that ton. He soon became a crowd-puller for just his eccentric batting. As entertaining as it was to the viewers, it sometimes proved to be infuriating to his teammates. His then captain, Wasim Akram, had repeatedly asked him not to throw his wicket away, but nothing could change Afridi's ways. This reckless streak extended to the highest format, the Test matches, and he was quickly sorted out by his opponents. After having some limited success in the longest format, Afridi quickly realized that he lacked the temperament for the same and announced his retirement from Tests in 2006, after having played just 26 games.
        
        He was more successful in the limited-overs format, where he influenced many games with a stunning cameo. After a while, his career completed a full circle as his quickish leg-breaks gained more importance. His tendency to rush through his overs was almost as influential. He mixed it up by bowling googlies and the quicker ones. On occasions, he even delivered the conventional off-break. This was interspersed with some stunning knocks such as the one against India in 2005 when he got to his hundred in 45 balls. This lethal combination made him one of the most valuable players going around in the shorter forms of the game. In fact, Sanath Jayasuriya and Afridi are the only two men to have made over 4,000 runs and taken over 300 wickets.
        
        The advent of T20 saw a rise in Afridi's value. He was named the Man of the Series in the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007 when Pakistan reached the final. He also scored fifties in both the semi-final and the final of the 2009 T20 World Cup and this time around, it helped Pakistan win the tournament. Soon after, he was named the captain of the T20 side. In 2010, after Mohammad Yousuf's exit, he was handed over the ODI reigns too. He even returned briefly to Tests to lead Pakistan in England, but retired immediately after the first game at Lord's, re-affirming that he was not suited for Tests. This did not hold him back from leading the Pakistan ODI team in the 2011 World Cup that saw him at the peak of his bowling prowess. He emerged as the joint highest wicket-taker along with Zaheer Khan. Both had 21 wickets.
        
        Controversies have dogged him throughout his career. After the age speculations died down, he was banned for two ODIs and a Test in 2005 after cameras caught him deliberately scuffing up the pitch with his boots in a Test against England. That was not the end of it, in 2010 he was found guilty of ball tampering when he was caught biting the ball in a ODI against Australia. A ban for two T20Is followed. In 2011 after a tour of the West Indies and following a rift with Pakistan coach, Waqar Younis, Afridi was sacked as the captain of the squad. His response to what he saw as unfair treatment being meted out by the board was to announce a conditional retirement. He soon sought a NOC from the PCB that would allow him to play for Hampshire. It was granted after both parties agreed to an out of court settlement.
        
        In October 2011, Afridi withdrew his conditional retirement and was selected for the Sri Lanka tour. In the fourth ODI, Afridi became the only cricketer to score a half-century and take five wickets on two separate occasions in ODIs. He also became the first person to score a fifty in his 50th T20 International in 2012. During the first ODI against West Indies in July 2013, Afridi produced an exceptional all-round performance. He scored an aggressive 76 to help Pakistan reach a respectable total of 224 and annihilated West Indies with a remarkable bowling spell of 7-12. In late 2013, Afridi had a decent run with the ball against both South Africa and Sri Lanka.
        
        Severely criticized for his lack of quality performances in recent times, Afridi silenced his critics in the 2014 Asia Cup by delivering outstanding back-to-back performances. In what was quoted to be a virtual semi-final against India, he hit a quick-fire 34 not out, giving Pakistan a thrilling last-over win. He bettered his previous performance in the next game against Bangladesh, equalling his own record for the second-fastest ODI fifty for the third time. Both these performances not only ensured Pakistan a spot in the final but also India's elimination from the tournament. Unfortunately, Afridi suffered a hamstring injury during that time. He did not get a chance to bat in the Asia Cup final against Sri Lanka and was mediocre with the ball as well. Afridi played some useful hands with both bat and ball in the World T20, but could not get Pakistan to qualify for the semi-finals.
        
        After Hafeez resigned from T20 captaincy, the Pakistani selectors went back to Afridi to lead them again. He also led the team when Misbah ul Haq decided to take a break in the third ODI against Australia. Afridi, always known for his irresponsible shots, curbed those instincts against New Zealand. The allrounder batted sensibly in almost every game, he made two fifties to show for it. Afridi, with his all-round skills, was expected to be a force to reckon with in the 2015 World Cup in Australia-New Zealand and got cameos in nearly every game as well. Pakistan ended with a quarterfinal finish and Afridi retired from the 50-over format, insisting that he would continue in the shortest format of the game.
        
        There were talks that Afridi was appointed captain in T20Is solely because he had informed the PCB regarding his retirement after the 2016 World T20. While there wasn't any clarity on this topic, it certainly did cause confusion within the team and in the Board. Pakistan's poor performances in the 2016 World T20 was the last straw and Afridi saw himself dropped after the tournament after the expected 'retirement' hadn't come.Afridi became the butt of social media jokes for his penchant for retirements that never lasted long. He retired five times in his career, only to return on four occasions. However, in February 2017, he announced it for one last time and decided to bid adieu to international cricket. Afridi has been enjoying his time in the franchise T20 leagues across the globe. He seems to have found his mojo back in T20 cricket as showcased by his performances in the 2017 Natwest T20 Blast in England where shone for Hampshire. A blistering century at the top of the order showed the world glimpses of his potential while his crafty leg spin bowling continued to create an impact. The BPL season has also seen him making a mark for the Dhaka Dynamites. Leaving the cricketing part aside, the aura that Afridi brought to the game was and shall always remain unparalleled. He will never change and so, till he retires from all forms of cricket, expect him to entertain the crowds to the fullest.</p>

    <h2>Shaheen Afridi</h2>
    <p>There is no denying the fact that Shaheen Afridi's potential is scaringly infinite. Blessed with a tall gangling frame and the ability to bowl really fast, Afridi also like his famous namesake can strike the ball really hard with the bat in hand. Add to all this his variety as a left-arm bowler and you know why there is immense excitement around this man in Pakistan. Born in a family of seven, Shaheen is the youngest of the lot and arguably, the most skilled as well. Despite being extremely passionate about cricket from his childhood, he was mostly into tennis-ball cricket before being guided into the real deal by his eldest brother Riaz, a one-Test wonder for Pakistan, who has also been Shaheen's inspiration and mentor.

        The transition has been extremely smooth for Shaheen who has rose up the ranks briskly in real quick time. Pakistan Super League has also helped, the platform allowing youngsters like him to rub shoulders with some of the best in business. The exposure has made Shaheen a tougher man and he is still in his teenage. He is still very raw and his domestic career has just taken off recently but there is enough to suggest that he could be a menace in the coming years, depending on how Pakistan handle him. He made his international debut during the T20I series at home against West Indies in 2018 and impressed with his skill set. After being in the radar for a while, he earned his maiden ODI call up for the Asia Cup in the same year.
        
        Shaheen also had an impressive campaign in the 2019 World Cup, despite not playing all the games. He generated good pace and also doled out fine variations at the death, ending up with 16 wickets in the tourney. Shaheen was one of the few shining lights for Pakistan who endured a disappointing tournament otherwise. Although he made his Test debut at the start of 2019, it shall be interesting to see how the PCB and the team management control his work load, given the youngster's injury-prone nature. At the moment, it seems wise to preserve him for the shorter formats where he is a deadly customer.</p>

    <h2>Wasim Akram</h2>
    <img src="../../images/akram.webp"  width="300px height=300px" />
    <p>Wasim Akram was one of those rare talents, who never played first-class cricket, before making his international debut. In fact, he could not even get into the college team. Born in a Punjabi Arain family in Lahore, Wasim Akram's magical moment came when he participated in the trials conducted at the Gaddafi Stadium. Interestingly, he was a mere spectator for the first two days and finally, got a chance to roll his arms over on the third day.

        Straightaway, he impressed Pakistan's senior cricket Javed Miandad, who then pressed for Akram's inclusion immediately into the national team. That was the opening the legend needed. From a bloke who was not even part of competitive cricket, Akram went on to become 'The King of Swing.' In fact, shockingly, Akram himself admitted that he did not know how to swing the ball during his early days.
        
        On November 23, 1984, Akram made his international debut in the second ODI against New Zealand at Faisalabad. Soon after, he made his Test debut against the same opposition at Auckland and in just his second Test appearance for Pakistan, he bagged a fifer each in both innings and grabbed eyeballs. He was a regular member of the side in the late 1980s, until an injury forced him to stay away.
        
        Post multiple surgeries, Akram returned to the international circuit and the emphasis was on mastering the art of swing bowling. He played a crucial role in Pakistan's success at the 1992 World Cup, while he also led them to the final, seven years later. Alongside Waqar Younis, Akram formed a fearsome bowling partnership and at a stage, the duo were literally unplayable.
        
        Akram scaled mountains quite easily with loads of wickets and even hat-tricks. The fact that he would go through the defences of many batsmen at will spoke volumes of his ability to trouble the batsman, both off the pitch and with movement in the air. During the 2003 World Cup, Akram became the first man on the planet to record 500 wickets in the 50-over format. Eventually, he finished his career as Pakistan's top wicket-taker in both Tests and ODIs. He was also the leading wicket-taker in ODIs, with 502 wickets, until Muttiah Muralitharan overtook him to push him to the second spot.
        
        As a 35-year-old, Akram announced his retirement from ODIs, after the 2003 World Cup. Akram had earlier quit Test cricket in 2002. He was a key figure in England's domestic circuit, having represented Lancashire and later Hampshire. Impressed by his show, fans would even sing \"Wasim for England,\" when he was in action for Lancashire.
        
        Post retirement, much like many former cricketers, Akram decided to voice his opinion on the game and became a prominent commentator. He is also the current coach of Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders since 2010 and helped them to be crowned champions in 2012 and 2014.
        
        Controversies:
        
        1. During the West Indies tour in 1993, Wasim Akram was arrested in Grenada, along with Waqar Younis, Aqib Javed, Mushtaq Ahmed and accused of possessing a drug called Marijuan. However, all four were released on bail and no evidence was found against them. This incident forced the first Test match, which was scheduled to start on April 15, to be postponed by one day.
        
        2. In 1992, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis came under heavy criticism from the English Media, who accused them of ball-tampering, after the duo rattled England in their own backyard with reverse swing.
        
        3. During the 1996 World Cup, just moments before the match, skipper Wasim Akram pulled out of Pakistan's quarter-final clash against India at Bangalore, forcing vice-captain Aamir Sohail to lead the side.
        
        4. In 1998, fast-bowler Ata-ur-Rahman accused Wasim Akram of offering him money to under-perform in a match against New Zealand at Christchurch in 1993-94. Later on, Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum, who conducted the inquiry into the fixing scandal, ruled that Akram cannot captain Pakistan again. While ruling the verdict, he then went on to say that he had a soft corner on Akram as he was a big fan of him.
